# Deep_Learning_Project
MLP and SLP model between two classes.
The task is to train a network to discriminate between sonar signals bounced
off a metal cylinder and those bounced off a roughly cylindrical rock.
The label associated with each record contains the letter "R" if the object
is a rock and "M" if it is a mine
